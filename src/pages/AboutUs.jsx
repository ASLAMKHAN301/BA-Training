const FAQ = () => {
  const [openIdx, setOpenIdx] = useState(0);
  const faqs = [
    {
      q: "What is CodersBloom?",
      a: "CodersBloom is a professional training organisation that was built in 2009 as an internal upskilling initiative for our own consulting teams. We opened it to external candidates after professionals around us saw the quality difference. Every programme is led by active industry practitioners — not full-time trainers — working on real project problems, with a maximum of ten participants per batch.",
    },
    {
      q: "Who teaches at CodersBloom?",
      a: "Every trainer is an active practitioner from our consulting ecosystem — Project Managers running live delivery programmes, Data Scientists working on production models, Business Analysts embedded in enterprise client projects, and Cybersecurity professionals in active engagements. They are not full-time educators. They teach from what they are doing this week, not from what they studied years ago.",
    },
    {
      q: "What courses does CodersBloom offer?",
      a: "We currently offer four career-track programmes: Business Analysis (BA), Cybersecurity, Project Management (PMP), and Data Science, AI & Machine Learning. Each is a complete end-to-end programme — not a collection of modules — designed to take you from your current background to employment in a specific professional role.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is CodersBloom different from other training institutes in India?",
      a: "Three structural differences — not marketing claims. First, our trainers are working practitioners, not professional educators. Second, the project work is from real consulting and client engagements, not manufactured classroom exercises. Third, batch size is capped at ten — giving every participant the kind of individual mentorship that is simply impossible at scale. Most institutes measure success by enrolment numbers. We measure it by employment outcomes.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the batch size at CodersBloom?",
      a: "Maximum ten participants per batch. This is a non-negotiable structural commitment — not a marketing line. Smaller batches allow trainers to track every participant's progress in detail, intervene early when someone is struggling, and provide the kind of personalised mentorship that shapes careers rather than just completing courses.",
    },
    {
      q: "What placement support does CodersBloom provide?",
      a: "We provide active, sustained placement support — not a certificate and a good luck. This includes resume building and positioning, LinkedIn and profile optimisation, direct recruiter introductions, company-specific interview preparation before every interview, and structured debrief after every interview. Our support continues post-placement for the first few months on the job, because the transition period matters.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you guarantee placement after the programme?",
      a: "We guarantee interviews — the offer is yours to earn. We will not stop supporting you until you have broken through. Most institutes stop at mock interviews. We work with you through real interviews — preparing specifically for each company and role, debriefing after each attempt, and refining your approach until it lands.",
    },
    {
      q: "In which cities is CodersBloom available?",
      a: "Our headquarters is in Hitech City, Hyderabad. We currently deliver training across 17 cities in India — Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Chennai, Noida, Gurgaon, Ahmedabad, Kochi, Vizag, Coimbatore, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Kolkata, Indore, Trivandrum, and New Delhi. All programmes are also available fully online with live instructor-led sessions, so location is not a barrier.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can working professionals join CodersBloom?",
      a: "Yes — every programme is designed for working professionals. Sessions are scheduled on weekday evenings and weekends. All live sessions are recorded and available on LMS within 24 hours. You can progress through the programme without interrupting your current employment, and we actively support professionals transitioning from adjacent roles rather than starting from scratch.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the fee for CodersBloom programmes?",
      a: "Fees vary by programme. Zero-cost EMI is available across all major credit cards for every programme. Merit-based scholarships are available for eligible candidates. There are no hidden fees — your full investment is disclosed upfront, and our advisors will walk through all options on a free counselling call before you make any commitment.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long has CodersBloom been running?",
      a: "Seventeen years. CodersBloom was established in 2009 as an internal training initiative for our consulting teams in Hyderabad. We have been training and placing professionals continuously since then — across more than 2,000 career transitions and 50+ hiring companies. The methodology has remained consistent because it continues to produce the outcomes that matter.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is CodersBloom only for software training?",
      a: "No. While our origins are in software delivery, we now train across four distinct career tracks: Business Analysis, Cybersecurity, Project Management, and Data Science / AI / ML. Each programme is built for professionals in or transitioning into technology roles — not exclusively for developers. Our BA, PM, and GRC tracks regularly attract candidates from non-engineering backgrounds.",
